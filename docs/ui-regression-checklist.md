# UI Regression Checklist

## Movement Smoothing
- Log into a world, hold `W` then change direction diagonally and confirm transitions stay eased with no snapping.
- Compare the move duration to `DEFAULT_MOVE_DURATION_MS` by counting tiles travelled; ensure long strides remain proportional.
- Watch NPC patrols for hitching after resizing the window; interpolation should remain smooth at 60 FPS.

## Pane Mechanics
- Desktop >= 1200px: click the HP orb (or press `S` in debug) to open the Stats pane; confirm the pane docks left, the canvas width clamps >= 640px, and closing with `Esc` restores layout.
- Desktop: click the MP orb to open Inventory; verify the pane docks right, retains scroll position on reopen, and outside clicks close it.
- Tablet 768-1199px: resize the window, open Stats/Inventory, ensure the overlay slides in, ESC + backdrop click closes, and focus returns to game.

## Chat + Quickbar
- With chat collapsed, send/receive a message; badge increments, preview updates, and `Show chat` opens the overlay without shifting the canvas.
- Keep chat unpinned, interact, and verify it auto-collapses after ~8s of inactivity; pinning disables auto-hide.
- Press numeric keys `1-8` while the canvas is focused; the matching quick slot highlights briefly and `bus` emits `quickbar:activate`.
- Hit `/` to open chat and focus the input, then `Esc` to collapse (when unpinned) without affecting panes.

## Responsive Behaviour
- Sweep viewport widths 480px to 1920px ensuring:
  - Canvas clamps to 16:9, horizontal scroll appears instead of shrinking below 640px.
  - Quickbar stays anchored between orbs; chat toggle relocates (fixed) on mobile.
  - Pane overlay switches between push (desktop) and float (tablet/mobile) with safe tap targets.
- Mobile (<768px) landscape: open chat; overlay behaves like a bottom sheet and world remains scrollable.

## Pane Scroll Checks
- Populate Inventories (use bank debug) and confirm overflow areas support native scroll momentum on all breakpoints.
- Switch between Stats <-> Inventory; the previously visited pane should restore its scroll offset and focus the first control when reopened.
